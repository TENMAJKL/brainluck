# BrainLuck

Rust implementation of BrainLuck.

Attempt to create programming language in rust. Source code of this language is pretty much the same as the one that is interpreted using this.

There will be some updates and new operators, but now I need some sleep ok.

Oh man it doesn't even check your file prefix.

Give me award for best name ever.
